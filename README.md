### Bengaluru Covid Analysis

This is a part of my college project to analyze Bengaluru covid cases and apply a Time series model.
Worked on Covid Project using (Programming Language – Python, Platform: Jupyter Notebook)
The project is about the covid dataset. First, we have to extract the data from 
pdf in a normal CSV le then clean the data and perform visualization, implemented few models just like time series, prediction between wave 1 and wave 2 and few algorithms
